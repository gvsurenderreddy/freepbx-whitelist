Three years and zero movement. Safe to say this module will never be done by me. You could conceivably do whitelist filtering by using the Dynroutes Module (https://github.com/johnfawcett/dynroute) and configuring the module to do a lookup for the number in The Asterisk phonebook (or any other database) and directing the call based on lookup result.
